# Gigabyte Z97-HD3 OpenCore
```
- This is an archive of my OpenCore configuration from mid 2022 for my old Gigabyte Z97 system. 

- This is not a drop-in replacement, and I do not recommend using it as-is.

- This config should only be used to help with troubleshooting, or help you get off the ground.

Here is a list of the hardware for which this config was made.

Board: Gigabyte Z97-HD3
Graphics: HP Radeon RX 460 2GB + Intel HD 4600
Processor: Intel Core i5-4400
Drive: SATA drive
Memory: shouldn't matter much

This config wasn't used with macOS newer than 11.5 Big Sur,
so compatibility with macOS 12.0+ is unknown.

This config should patch the BCM94331CD Wireless card in macOS 10.14 Mojave and 10.15 Catalina.
Boot arguments for macOS 11.0+ support have to be added manually because of the iMac SMBIOS. You can also change it.
